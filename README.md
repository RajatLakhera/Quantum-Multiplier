# QOSF(Cohort 6)-Screening-Task

This short project was done for the QOSF Mentorship Program. As part of the screening process, I worked on the "Task 1" where it was asked to create a quantum multiplier function. Necessary comments have been made within the code itself. 
In addition, to better summarize the task I've added a short document which also mentions the bonus questions asked at the end of the task.
